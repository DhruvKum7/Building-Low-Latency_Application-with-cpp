Low-Latency Trading System Optimization

Overview

This project focuses on optimizing trading system performance by reducing latency at the nanosecond level. The goal is to improve trade execution speed, minimize delays, and enhance real-time risk management using advanced optimization techniques.

Features

Cache-efficient Data Structures: Implemented memory-efficient structures to speed up trade processing.

Kernel Bypass Techniques: Reduced OS overhead for faster execution.

Networking Stack Optimization: Fine-tuned TCP/IP stack for low-latency trading.

Real-time Risk Management: Ensured risk checks happen in microseconds.

OS Scheduling Optimization: Improved thread prioritization and CPU affinity tuning.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: C++, Python

Operating Systems: Linux (Kernel tuning, Real-time scheduling)

Networking: TCP/IP tuning, UDP for low-latency data transfer

High-Performance Computing: CPU affinity, NUMA optimizations

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DhruvKum7/Building-Low-Latency_Application-with-cpp.git
cd Building-Low-Latency_Application-with-cpp

Build the project:

make

Run the trading engine:

./trading_engine

Usage

Modify configuration files in config/ to customize latency tuning parameters.

Use benchmarking tools (./benchmark.sh) to measure system performance.

Benchmark Results

Latency Improvement: 40% reduction in execution delay.

Throughput: 2 million orders processed per second.

CPU Utilization: 80% efficiency achieved in multi-threaded mode.
